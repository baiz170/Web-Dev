        <h2 id="first-post">First Post: Hello, World!</h2>
        <h6>Posted on January 26, 2026</h6>
        <p>Today I wrote my very first lines of code! It was both exciting and a little confusing at first, but I managed to create a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.</p>
        <p>I'm really excited to continue learning programming and explore more about HTML, CSS, and eventually JavaScript!</p>

        <h2 id="second-post">Second Post: My First Project</h2>
        <h6>Posted on January 27, 2026</h6>
        <p>After learning the basics, I decided to make my first small project: a personal webpage. I added headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Styling it with CSS made it really look like a proper webpage!</p>
        <p>It's amazing to see how HTML structure and CSS styling work together. Next, I plan to add a table and a list of my favorite programming resources.</p>
